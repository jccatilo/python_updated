In this section, you will know the roadmap I made to learn python on different levels. This can also serve as my, also your own, cheatsheets during programming tasks. We should note that this is pure python. No ML, AI, Data Science libraries used or any framework included. I've noticed during my projects that includes Data Science and ML, I mostly struggle with the basics which also pushed me to create this repo for myself and others like me who just wants to do cool projects quickly by creating a reference/cheatsheet. Hope this repo helps.

The levels are divided into Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert. Just click on the hyperlinks. Enjoy!
